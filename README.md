# Round

This is a 2D platformer game I created in Unity. The goal of the game is to collect all the gems.

Details:
- I have created two types of hazards an enemy and spike hazard which kills the player upon touch.
- I added to the game a moving box character which can push the player as well as act as a platform to jump on
- Using Unity's build settings I was able to create an APK for Android
